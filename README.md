# React Fundamentals : WeatherApp  
  
Application following the [react tutorial](https://tylermcginnis.com/) by [Tyler McGinnis](https://github.com/tylermcginnis). I made this application after watching his ES6 tutorial and hence, the project is in accordance with the ES6 standards.

Special thanks to [Tyler McGinnis](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis) for his content. His videos are brilliant and helped me a lot. If anyone stumbles upon this repo, please do go give him a shout out!
  
The stepwise instructions for developing this application can be found [here](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/react-fundamentals-curriculum/tree/master)  

For some quick styling, I have used [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and so the app is responsive.

I barely consulted the original code (I made use of only helpers.js) and therefore there is some difference in styling and structure of his code and mine.

I haven't hosted the application yet, but here are some screenshots.
