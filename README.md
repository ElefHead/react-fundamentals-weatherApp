# React Fundamentals : WeatherApp  
  
Application following the [react tutorial](https://tylermcginnis.com/) by [Tyler McGinnis](https://github.com/tylermcginnis).  
  
The stepwise instructions for developing this application can be found [here](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/react-fundamentals-curriculum/tree/master)  

I made this application after checking out the ES7 tutorial by Tyler McGinnis and made in accordance with it.
For some quick styling, I have used [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

I barely consulted the original code (I made use of only helpers.js) and therefore there is some difference in styling and structure of his code and mine.

I haven't hosted the application yet, but I will post some screenshots.
